Smart Cultural 
Storyteller
Reviving heritage with AI to preserve cultural narratives for 
future generations
The Problem
Cultural Disconnect
Many folk tales, traditions, and historical stories are 
underrepresented in modern formats.
Digital Transformation Need
Traditional storytelling methods aren't engaging enough 
for younger, digitally-native audiences.
How can we use AI to preserve and retell cultural stories in engaging, interactive, and accessible ways4especially for younger 
generations?
